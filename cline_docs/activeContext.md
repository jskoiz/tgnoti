## Current Initiative: Dependency Injection Improvements (2025-02-21)

### Overview
Addressing critical dependency injection issues:
- CircuitBreaker service failing to resolve Logger dependency
- Need for systematic DI configuration improvements
- Potential similar issues in other services

### Status
- Identified CircuitBreaker DI configuration issue
- Created ADR 005 for comprehensive DI improvements
- Planning systematic review of all service dependencies

### Problem Description
The system has several DI-related challenges:
- CircuitBreaker constructor requires Logger but DI container isn't properly configured
- No standardized approach to dependency injection configuration
- Potential similar issues in other services with constructor dependencies
- Lack of validation for dependency resolution

### Impact
- Application startup failures
- Potential runtime issues in other services
- Inconsistent dependency management
- Difficult troubleshooting of DI issues

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix CircuitBreaker binding in container.ts
2. Review other services with constructor dependencies:
   - TwitterClient
   - SearchStrategy
   - TweetProcessor
   - MessageFormatter

### Next Steps
1. Implement CircuitBreaker fix
2. Create service registration pattern
3. Add container validation layer
4. Review and update other service bindings
5. Add tests for dependency resolution
6. Document new DI patterns

## Current Initiative: Search Window Configuration Simplification (2025-02-21)

### Overview
Simplified the search window configuration to use a centralized approach:
- Created SearchConfig service to manage search window settings
- Unified date validation and window creation
- Moved configuration to twitter.ts
- Resolved circular dependencies through interface abstraction
- Updated search window to 5 days for more focused monitoring

### Status
- Created SearchConfig service in /src/config/searchConfig.ts
- Added searchWindow configuration to TwitterConfig interface
- Updated DateValidator to use SearchConfig
- Updated TweetProcessor to use SearchConfig
- Centralized search window settings in twitter.ts
- Created IDateValidator interface to break circular dependencies
- Successfully tested 5-day search window functionality
- Improved message formatting with better visual separation

### Problem Description
The system had several architectural challenges:
- Search window configuration spread across multiple components
- Circular dependency between DateValidator and SearchConfig
- TweetProcessor.createSearchWindow() set window size
- DateValidator.maxPastDays validated the window
- Both needed to be in sync

### Impact
- Inconsistent search window validation
- Configuration spread across multiple files
- Potential for mismatched settings
- Initialization issues due to circular dependencies

### Solutions Implemented
1. Centralized Configuration:
   - Added searchWindow to TwitterConfig:
     ```typescript
     searchWindow: {
       pastDays: 5,
       futureDays: 7,
       defaultWindow: 5
     }
     ```
   - Created SearchConfig service to manage window settings
   - Updated DateValidator to use SearchConfig
   - Updated TweetProcessor to use SearchConfig

2. Improved Validation:
   - Single source of truth for window settings
   - Consistent validation across components
   - Proper error messages with actual limits

3. Resolved Circular Dependencies:
   - Created IDateValidator interface in types/dateValidator.ts
   - Updated SearchConfig to depend on interface instead of concrete class
   - Modified DateValidator initialization to support two-phase construction
   - Improved container initialization order

### Code Areas Affected
1. src/config/twitter.ts - Added searchWindow configuration
2. src/config/searchConfig.ts - New service for window management
3. src/utils/dateValidation.ts - Updated to use SearchConfig
4. src/core/TweetProcessor.ts - Updated to use SearchConfig
5. src/config/environment.ts - Added searchWindow to twitter config
6. src/types/dateValidator.ts - New interface for breaking circular dependency
7. src/config/container.ts - Updated initialization order
8. src/bot/messageFormatter.ts - Improved message formatting

### Next Steps
1. Monitor search window validation
2. Consider adding metrics for window validation
3. Update documentation with new configuration details
4. Consider adding validation for configuration changes at runtime
