# Progress Log

## 2025-02-22: Telegram Message Queue Implementation

### Issue
System was encountering frequent Telegram API rate limits, causing message delivery failures and wasted resources. Messages were being sent immediately without proper rate limit handling or retry mechanisms.

### Resolution
1. Implemented TelegramMessageQueue:
   - Created priority-based message queue system
   - Added intelligent rate limit handling
   - Implemented exponential backoff retries
   - Added queue status monitoring
   - Integrated with existing metrics system

2. Enhanced Rate Limit Handling:
   - Added dynamic rate window tracking
   - Implemented Retry-After header respect
   - Created proactive rate limit prevention
   - Added configurable rate limits per window

3. Added Monitoring and Metrics:
   - Queue length tracking
   - Success/failure rates
   - Processing time metrics
   - Rate limit hit tracking
   - Queue status reporting

4. Integrated with TelegramBot:
   - Updated message sending to use queue
   - Added queue status to bot commands
   - Added circuit breaker support
   - Improved error handling

### Current Status
- Queue system fully implemented and operational
- Rate limiting working effectively
- Messages being delivered reliably
- Monitoring metrics active
- Bot status command showing queue metrics

### Next Steps
- Implement queue persistence
- Add dead letter queue
- Create admin interface
- Consider distributed queue system

## 2025-02-21: Twitter Client Implementation Improvements

### Issue
TwitterClient implementation was incomplete with unimplemented methods and lacking proper error handling.

### Resolution
1. Enhanced TwitterClient:
   - Implemented complete performSearch method
   - Added proper error handling with typed errors
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Added comprehensive metrics tracking
   - Added parameter sanitization
   - Added result validation

2. Enhanced RettiwtKeyManager:
   - Added key health monitoring
   - Implemented smart key rotation based on health metrics
   - Added automatic recovery from rate limits
   - Added error tracking and statistics
   - Added health metrics tracking

3. Added Error Handling Framework:
   - Created typed error hierarchy
   - Added retry strategies
   - Implemented error recovery paths
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Added error context preservation

4. Added Testing Infrastructure:
   - Created comprehensive test suite
   - Added error scenario coverage
   - Added rate limit handling tests
   - Added parameter validation tests

### Current Status
- Twitter client fully implemented and tested
- Error handling framework in place
- Key management system working efficiently
- All tests passing

## 2025-02-21: Tweet Search and Processing Improvements

### Issue
Search functionality was missing tweets due to case sensitivity in Twitter handles and using overly broad search windows.

### Investigation
- Found case mismatches in account handles:
  - "TradeonNova" vs actual "TradeOnNova"
  - "tradewithPhoton" vs actual "TradeWithPhoton"
- Identified 7-day search window as potential performance issue
- Discovered need for reliable time verification

### Resolution
1. Fixed case sensitivity:
   - Updated account handles in config.json
   - Verified correct capitalization against Twitter profiles
   - Updated all affected configurations

2. Improved date handling:
   - Reduced search window from 7 days to 24 hours
   - Implemented online time verification
   - Added multiple time API sources with fallback
   - Added time source caching (1-minute cache)

3. Enhanced search execution:
   - Updated TwitterClient search implementation
   - Fixed queue type handling for async operations
   - Improved error handling for search failures

### Current Status
- Application starts successfully
- Container initialization completes without errors
- Telegram bot connects successfully
- Search using correct case-sensitive handles
- Using 24-hour search windows
- Online time verification active
- Rate limiting functioning properly

### Next Steps
- Monitor tweet processing success rate
- Verify online time verification reliability
- Consider adding metrics for time source availability
- Update documentation with case sensitivity requirements

## 2024-02-19: Search Implementation Issues

### Issue
Search functionality not finding tweets despite confirmed existence on Twitter. Getting "Invalid search config" errors after switching to proper accounts/mentions fields.

### Investigation
- Changed from using keywords with "from:" and "@" prefixes to proper accounts/mentions fields
- Updated SearchQueryConfig type and RettiwtSearchBuilder
- Still encountering validation errors with new configuration

### Current Status
- Application starts successfully
- Container initialization completes without errors
- Telegram bot connects successfully
- Search validation failing with new configuration
- No tweets being processed despite existence

### Next Steps
- Debug search configuration validation
- Test with simpler search configurations
- Add more detailed logging for search filter construction
- Consider reverting to keywords approach if API limitations found

## 2024-02-19: Fixed Dependency Injection Configuration

### Issue
Application was failing to start due to missing dependency bindings for TwitterNotifier service and its dependencies.

### Resolution
- Added missing service bindings in container.ts:
  - MessageValidator
  - Storage (with proper dependencies)
  - SearchBuilder
  - TwitterNotifier
- Reordered initialization to ensure dependencies are available before use
- Fixed basePath calculation timing

### Current Status
- Application starts successfully
- Container initialization completes without errors
- Telegram bot connects successfully
- Twitter monitoring is active and processing tweets
- Rate limiting is functioning (1 request/second)

### Next Steps
- Monitor application for any other potential issues
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
- Look into adding metrics for monitoring tweet processing performance
