# Active Development Context

## Current Session (2025-02-23)

### Focus Area
Implementing new pipeline architecture to reduce complexity and improve debugging capabilities

### Recent Changes
1. Created new pipeline architecture:
   - Implemented TweetProcessingPipeline orchestrator
   - Created base pipeline types and interfaces
   - Implemented pipeline stages:
     - FetchStage: Responsible for tweet retrieval
     - ValidationStage: Handles validation and deduplication
     - FilterStage: Manages content filtering
     - FormatStage: Handles message formatting
     - SendStage: Manages Telegram message delivery

2. Improved error handling:
   - Added stage-specific error handling
   - Implemented comprehensive logging
   - Added performance metrics tracking

3. Enhanced state management:
   - Clear stage progression
   - Improved context passing
   - Better error recovery

4. Implemented Monitoring Dashboard:
   - Created MonitoringDashboard class for centralized monitoring
   - Added real-time pipeline metrics tracking
   - Implemented topic-level metrics monitoring
   - Added system health monitoring
   - Integrated with SendStage for metrics collection
   - Added queue performance tracking

5. Migration Infrastructure:
   - Created MigrationManager for controlled migration
   - Implemented parallel processing capability
   - Added validation and comparison logic
   - Set up metrics tracking
   - Created migration validator script
    - Added migration-specific validation mode
   - Fixed FetchStage implementation to handle existing data

### Current Goals
1. ✅ Fix remaining type issues in SendStage
2. ❌ Implement pipeline integration tests (Decided not to implement)
3. ✅ Add monitoring dashboards
4. ✅ Create migration infrastructure
5. ✅ Fix ValidationStage issues during migration

### Open Questions
1. ✅ Should we add more granular metrics for each stage?
   - Implemented comprehensive metrics in MonitoringDashboard
2. ✅ Do we need additional validation checks in any stages?
   - Identified issue with ValidationStage during migration
   - Need to modify validation logic for migration phase
3. ✅ Should we implement circuit breakers for external services? (Implemented in SendStage)

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete SendStage implementation
2. ❌ Add comprehensive tests (Decided not to implement)
3. ✅ Create monitoring dashboard
4. ✅ Create migration validator
5. Fix ValidationStage migration issues:
   - ✅ Added migration-specific validation mode to handle duplicate tweets

### Technical Decisions
1. Using pipeline pattern for clear processing flow
2. Implementing comprehensive metrics
3. Adding strong typing throughout
4. Using dependency injection for better testing
5. Created centralized monitoring dashboard for better observability
6. Integrated monitoring with SendStage for real-time metrics
7. Implemented parallel processing for migration validation

### Blockers
✅ All previous blockers resolved

### Notes
- Pipeline architecture significantly improves debugging capabilities
- Each stage has clear responsibilities
- Error handling is more robust
- Metrics will help identify bottlenecks
- Monitoring dashboard provides real-time insights into system health
- Queue performance tracking helps optimize message delivery
- Migration validation shows promising results after ValidationStage fixes
- Ready to proceed with full migration testing
