# Active Development Context

## Recent Changes

### Dependency Injection Improvements
- Fixed missing service bindings for CircuitBreaker, Environment, MessageStorage, and SearchConfig
- Resolved circular dependency between DateValidator and SearchConfig using two-phase initialization
- Updated TweetFormatter binding to correctly use EnhancedMessageFormatter
- Added proper configuration bindings for services
- Documented initialization patterns in ADR 012

### Current System State
- Application successfully initializes and runs with 13ms initialization time
- Twitter Notifier operational with 4 API keys
- Tweet processing cycles active and processing correctly
- Search windows properly validated (5-day window working)
- Filter building operational with complex filters
- System time validation passing
- Database schema initialized
- Metrics collection active and reporting:
  * notifier.init_time: 13ms
  * search.filters.complex: 1
  * search.filter_build_time: 0ms
  * twitter.search.attempt: 1
  * date.validation.success: 2

### Service Health
- CircuitBreaker: Operational
- Environment: Validated successfully
- MessageStorage: Initialized
- TweetFormatter: Properly bound
- SearchConfig: Connected to DateValidator and providing correct search windows (2025-02-18 to 2025-02-23)
- Twitter API: Connected with 4 API keys and processing searches
- Database: Schema initialized
- DateValidator: Validating times correctly (2025-02-23T21:42:03.041Z)
- FilterBuilder: Creating complex filters successfully with parameters:
  * Language: en
  * Users: TradeWithPhoton
  * Date Range: 5 days
  * Links: false
  * Retweets: true
  * Quotes: true

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Monitor the system for any remaining dependency issues
2. Add validation tests for dependency injection configuration
3. Consider implementing dependency graph visualization
4. Review and potentially optimize service initialization order

### Medium Term
1. Implement automated tests for dependency injection
2. Create service dependency documentation
3. Consider adding health checks for initialized services
4. Review and update error handling for initialization failures

### Long Term
1. Consider implementing a more robust service lifecycle management system
2. Plan for potential service discovery implementation
3. Evaluate need for dynamic service configuration
4. Consider containerization strategy for services

## Known Issues
1. Fixed: Search filter was creating redundant conditions by adding fromUsers to includeWords array
   - Impact: Could cause API hangs due to duplicate search criteria
   - Resolution: Removed automatic addition of fromUsers to includeWords when no keywords provided

## Recent Metrics
- Initialization time: 13ms
- Tweet processing cycles: Active and successful
- Service initialization: Successful
- Configuration validation: Passed
- Search filter building: Working correctly
- Date validation: Passing all checks

## Documentation Updates
- Added ADR 012 for dependency injection improvements
- Updated systemPatterns.md with new initialization patterns
- Current documentation reflects latest system architecture and operational status
