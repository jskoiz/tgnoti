# Architectural Decision Log

## 2025-02-23 - Migration Strategy Implementation

### Context
With the new pipeline architecture ready, we need a safe and controlled way to migrate from the existing implementation to the new one. Initial testing revealed challenges with validation during the migration phase.

### Decision
1. Parallel Processing Strategy
   - Run both old and new implementations simultaneously
   - Compare results for validation
   - Track performance metrics
   - Log discrepancies

2. Migration Tools
   - Created MigrationManager class for orchestration
   - Implemented migration validator script
   - Added comprehensive metrics tracking
   - Built-in rollback capability

3. Validation Strategy
   - Process tweets through both implementations
   - Compare success/failure states
   - Track timing differences
   - Monitor error rates

4. FetchStage Optimization
   - Skip re-fetching when complete data exists
   - Add metadata for fetch operations
   - Track fetch performance metrics
   - Improve error handling

5. ValidationStage Modifications (Implemented)
   - Added migration-specific validation mode:
     * Added isMigration flag to TweetContext
      * Updated PipelineConfig to support migration mode
      * Modified ValidationStage to skip duplicate check sduring migration
   - Implementation Details:
      * MigrationManager sets isMigration flag on context
      * TweetProcessingPipeline propagates flag to config
      * ValidationStage checks flag before duplicate validation
    - Benefits:
      * Prevents false negatives during migration
      * Maintains data integrity checks
      * Enables parallel processing validation
      * Provides clear migration metrics
    - Validation Focus:
      * Content validity remains enforced
      * Engagement metrics still checked
      * Only duplicate checks are skipped

### Implementation Details
1. MigrationManager features:
   - Parallel tweet processing
   - Result comparison logic
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error tracking and logging

2. Migration Validator script:
   - Processes sample tweets through both systems
   - Generates detailed comparison reports
   - Provides success rate calculations
   - Offers migration recommendations

3. FetchStage Improvements:
   - Added data completeness checks
   - Implemented skip logic for existing data
   - Enhanced metadata tracking
   - Improved error handling

### Status
Initial testing revealed:
- FetchStage improvements working as expected
- ValidationStage needs modification for migration phase
- Parallel processing infrastructure working correctly
- Metrics collection providing valuable insights

### Next Steps
1. Modify ValidationStage to handle migration phase
2. Add migration-specific validation mode
3. Update validation metrics
4. Re-run validation tests

### Success Metrics
1. No duplicate tweet processing
2. Consistent validation results
3. Improved processing efficiency
4. Clear error tracking
5. Comprehensive migration metrics

## 2025-02-23 - Monitoring Dashboard Implementation

### Context
With the new pipeline architecture in place, we needed a comprehensive monitoring solution to track system health, performance, and processing metrics in real-time.

### Decision
Implement a centralized MonitoringDashboard that provides:

1. Pipeline Metrics
   - Stage-specific success/failure rates
   - Processing times per stage
   - Queue status and performance
   - Error tracking by type

2. Topic-level Monitoring
   - Messages processed per topic
   - Success/failure rates
   - Processing times
   - Error rates

3. System Health Tracking
   - Rate limiting status
   - Circuit breaker state
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Queue performance metrics

### Implementation Details
1. Created MonitoringDashboard class with:
   - Centralized metrics collection
   - Real-time updates
   - Comprehensive data structures
   - Type-safe interfaces

2. Integration with SendStage for:
   - Queue performance tracking
   - Error monitoring
   - System health checks
   - Metrics collection

### Status
Implemented and integrated with SendStage. Provides real-time insights into system performance and health.

## 2025-02-23 - Notification System Simplification

### Context
The notification system has grown complex with multiple layers of processing, redundant validations, and scattered state management. This is causing issues with unwanted random tweets and making debugging difficult.

### Current Pain Points
1. Complex Processing Chain
   - Multiple layers make it hard to track tweet flow
   - Numerous validation steps scattered across components
   - Complex error handling distributed across layers

2. State Management Issues
   - Multiple storage files (lastTweetId.json, seenTweets.json)
   - Configuration spread across multiple files
   - Complex dependency injection setup

3. Redundant Processing
   - Multiple date validation steps
   - Repeated tweet checks
   - Overlapping error handling

### Decision
Implement a simplified architecture with clear responsibilities and streamlined processing:

1. Command Chain Pattern
   - Implement a clear chain of command for tweet processing
   - Each step in the chain has a single responsibility
   - Clear entry and exit points for data

2. Centralized State Management
   - Consolidate storage into a single source of truth
   - Centralize configuration management
   - Implement a state manager for runtime data

3. Unified Processing Pipeline
   - Single validation layer
   - Consolidated error handling
   - Clear processing stages

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Restructuring
1. Create TweetProcessingPipeline
   - Single entry point for tweet processing
   - Clear stages: Fetch → Validate → Filter → Format → Send
   - Each stage has a single responsibility

2. Implement StateManager
   - Consolidate lastTweetId and seenTweets
   - Provide clear interface for state access
   - Handle persistence automatically

3. Create ConfigurationManager
